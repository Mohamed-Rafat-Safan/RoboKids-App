# RoboKids-App
This is my graduation project, and it is about a smart educational application for children, 
and this application contains a lot of features and is divided into two parts, a part for parents and a part for children ..
where the part of parents can register within the application and add their children within the application.
Parents can access it and know their children's use of the application and track them while they are using the application,
and we know how much time they spent in each of the educational and recreational sections ... 
And the children's section is divided into two parts, an educational section and an entertainment section.

The educational section contains:
  1- Teaching pronunciation: where we take the sound of the letter or word from the child and analyze it using machine learning, 
  and we can say whether the child pronounced the letter correctly or not.
  
  2- Learning to write: where we take from the child the word or letter that he wrote on the board inside the application and
  analyze it using machine learning and we can say whether the child wrote the letter or word correctly or not.
  
  3- Questions and tests: where the child can test himself on what he has learned within the two sections, pronunciation and writing.

And the entertainment section inside the application is intended to satisfy the child after studying, 
as there is a section for movies, songs and games to entertain himself after studying.


And the tools used within the application:

  language: Kotlin , Navigation component , Coroutines , 
  dependency injection by (Dagger Hilt) , architectural pattern by (MVVM) , 
  Firebase , Glide , lottie for animation , connect bluetooth of adruino , 
  Chacopy to connect the application with machine learning , 
  multiple screen (sdp-ssp) .
